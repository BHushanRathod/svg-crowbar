#svg-crowbar

A bookmarklet that extracts SVG nodes and accompanying styles from an HTML document and downloads them as an SVG fileâ€”A file which you could open and edit in Adobe Illustrator, for instance. Because SVGs are resolution independent, it works great for using web technologies to create documents that are meant to be printed.
